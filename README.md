# Face Recognition Attendance System for Day Laborers

## Project Description

The Face Recognition Attendance System for Day Laborers offers a comprehensive solution for managing attendance and productivity, specifically catering to day laborers, especially those in the waste disposal industry.

### Problem

Traditional attendance tracking methods, such as manual registers, are often time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency. This leads to inaccurate payroll calculations, decreased productivity, and inefficiencies in waste disposal operations.

### Solution

This system utilizes facial recognition technology to automate attendance recording, ensuring accurate and reliable data. With various functionalities, it significantly improves upon traditional methods.

## Key Features

- **Face Recognition:** Eliminates buddy punching, ensuring accurate attendance records.
- **Automated Reports:** Generates detailed reports on individual and collective worker attendance, hours worked, and location data.
- **Payroll Integration:** Streamlines payroll processing by automatically calculating wages based on recorded attendance.
- **Centralized Dashboard:** Provides a real-time comprehensive overview of worker activity and performance metrics.
- **GPS Tracking:** Enables real-time monitoring of worker location for transparency and route optimization.
- **Geo-Fencing:** Creates virtual boundaries around work areas to ensure worker presence and productivity.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Administrative Overhead:** Automates manual tasks and eliminates paper-based records.
- **Improved Accuracy and Transparency:** Ensures accurate attendance records and eliminates fraudulent activities.
- **Enhanced Worker Productivity:** Provides insights into worker activity, aiding in identifying areas for improvement.
